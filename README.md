# Advanced CSS: Portfolio 

## User Story
As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position. 

## Acceptance Criteria
When the portfolio loads, then the employer is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
When the links are clicked, then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
When the employer clicks on the link to the section about the potential employee's work, then the UI scrolls to the work section with titled images of the developer's applications.
When the employer is presented with the developer's first application, then the application's image should be larger in size than the other projects.
When the employer clicks on the images of the applications, they are then taken to that deployed application. 
When the page is resized, then the employer is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport. 

## The Project
The assignment was created to apply the newly developed html and css skills that we learnt during class. The assignment also allowed us to implement our Flexbox and Media Querries knowledge within the advanced CSS files. A reset css file was also added into the html file to help with the functionality of different browsers on a variety of different pieces of technology!
